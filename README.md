# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## About this App 
This is a workday planner that displays the current date and time that will help the user with scheduling their tasks throughout the day.
The user is able to enter text into the rows for each hour and clicking on the save icon will save the text in that row.
The color of the row will change depending if the current time is in the past hour (gray), current hour (red), or future hour (green).
When the page is refreshed, the tasks for each row will persist.
